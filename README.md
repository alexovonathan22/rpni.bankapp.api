## Overview
This project uses GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline includes the following stages:
1. **Build**: Compiles the application.
2. **Test**: Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to the test environment.

## Workflow
The CI/CD workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml` file. Below is a summary of the workflow:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
        # Add your deployment script here
```

## Setup
To set up the CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Create the workflow file**:
    Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and add the workflow definition provided above.

3. **Configure secrets**:
    Add any necessary secrets (e.g., deployment keys) to your GitHub repository under **Settings > Secrets**.

## Usage
To trigger the CI/CD pipeline, push changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request targeting the `main` branch. The pipeline will automatically run the build, test, and deploy stages.
